# Hand Signs Project
## Background and Rationale
Sign language is a visual communication system designed for individuals with hearing impairments, relying on hand movements, facial expressions, and body language to convey messages accurately and fluidly. The body parts involved include hands, fingers, eyes, and face, which contribute to the creation of diverse and complex expressions in this language.

Due to the communication barrier between hearing individuals and those with hearing impairments, particularly among children with hearing and speech disabilities, there is a need for early learning of sign language by children and their families. This learning can reduce the communication barrier and facilitate their social integration.

The integration of modern technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision offers an innovative solution for making the learning of sign language more accessible. These technologies can lead to personalized learning processes, enhance educational efficiency, and assist in acquiring new knowledge quickly and interactively.
